# Etch-A-Sketch

Here is a simple Etch-A-Sketch clone I made using simple DOM manipulation and event listeners.

### What I learned:

- Developed a better handle of DOM manipulation and event listeners
- Gained more comfort with writing javascript functions and passing information between functions
- Started using css flexbox and grid, getting more comfortable

### What I would like to work on:

- Struggling with keeping the layout responsive, defintely need more reading
- Would like to add a few options for switching colors/ patterns / behaviors
